# Product Context

## Problem Solved
The platform addresses the fragmented, often manual, and unreliable process of booking intercity bus tickets in certain regions. It aims to provide a unified, digital solution for both travelers (passengers) and independent bus operators (transporteurs), reducing errors, improving convenience, and increasing trust.

## Core Functionality (MVP)
- **Travelers:** Search for trips, view details, select seats, provide passenger info (Name+CNI), pay securely (Mobile Money, Card), receive QR e-tickets, and manage bookings.
- **Transporteurs:** Register their company (admin approval needed), manage their bus fleet, create and publish trip schedules, and validate passenger tickets offline using QR code/CNI scanning.
- **Admin:** Oversee the platform, manage users and transporters, monitor bookings/revenue, handle finances (commissions, refunds), and view basic analytics.

## User Experience Goals
- **Simplicity:** A straightforward "search → book → pay → ride" flow for travelers.
- **Reliability:** Dependable booking process and robust offline ticket validation for operators.
- **Accessibility:** Adherence to WCAG AA standards for usability.
- **Consistency:** Uniform UI/UX across mobile (Android/iOS) and web platforms.
- **Security:** Secure handling of payments and personal data (especially CNI), complying with GDPR-style principles.
