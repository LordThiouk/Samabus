# Progress

## Current Status
- **Overall:** Project initialized, basic Auth UI implemented, DB schema and models defined. Focus is now on completing Auth logic and navigation.
- **Functionality:** App builds cleanly. DB schema ready for migration. Task 1.3 (Auth UI / Navigation) is in progress.

## What Works
- Flutter project setup & platform support.
- Task management system.
- Memory Bank populated.
- Basic UI implemented for `SignupScreen` (Task 1.1 - Done).
- DB Schema defined & Dart models created (Task 1.2 - Done).
- Basic UI implemented for `LoginScreen`.
- Code passes `flutter analyze` with only info-level suggestions.

## What's Left To Build (Immediate Focus)
- **Task 1.3 (Auth UI / Navigation - In Progress):**
    - Implement `ForgotPasswordScreen` UI.
    - Implement phone/email verification UI (if needed).
    - Connect Auth UI fully to providers/services.
    - Implement role-based navigation.
- Apply DB migrations to Supabase.
- Implement localization fully.

## Known Issues
- **Analyzer Info Messages:** Several `const` suggestions remain (non-blocking).
- **Placeholders:** UI text uses placeholder strings instead of localization.
- **Terminal Instability:** Potential issues with PowerShell environment (monitor).
- **Incomplete Backend Integration:** Auth UI needs full connection to services.
- **Migrations:** DB migration files need timestamps updated and must be applied.
