# Progress

## Current Status
- **Overall:** Core authentication flow (signup, signin, password reset, logout, role handling) and role-based routing/redirection using `go_router` are implemented. Session persistence is handled by `supabase_flutter`. The transporteur screen checks for approval status.
- **Functionality:** User can navigate between auth screens, splash screen shows, login/signup calls the provider, role-based home screens exist, logout works, transporteur approval check is implemented. App builds cleanly. Unit tests for `AuthProvider` are stable.
- **Next:** Implement Widget Tests for Authentication screens.

## What Works (Completed in this phase)
- Flutter project setup & platform support.
- Task management system.
- Memory Bank populated.
- Supabase DB Schema & RLS applied (Task 1.2 - Done).
- Dart models aligned with schema.
- Auth UI Screens (`LoginScreen`, `SignupScreen`, `ForgotPasswordScreen`) implemented.
- `SplashScreen` implemented (shows branding/loading, relies on router redirect).
- `AuthService` and `AuthProvider` implemented for core auth actions and state management.
- `AuthProvider` fetches user profile (incl. role) after sign-in/sign-up.
- Role-based routing/navigation implemented using `go_router` and `AuthProvider`.
- Placeholder role-specific home screens (`TravelerHomeScreen`, `TransporteurHomeScreen`, `AdminDashboardScreen`) created and integrated into router.
- `TransporteurHomeScreen` shows conditional UI based on `isApproved` status.
- Logout functionality implemented via `AuthProvider` and router redirect.
- Session persistence handled by `supabase_flutter`.
- Code passes `flutter analyze` with only info-level suggestions.
- **Unit Tests:**
    - `AuthProvider` tests are stable and passing (with noted compromise on specific `errorMessage` assertion).
    - `AuthService` tests verify interactions with mocked Supabase client (excluding `getCurrentUserAppModel` due to mocking limitations).
- **Widget Tests:**
    - Basic tests for Auth Screens (`LoginScreen`, `SignupScreen`, `ForgotPasswordScreen`) are passing.
    - Basic test for `SplashScreen` rendering is passing.
    - Basic tests for Role Home Screens (`TravelerHomeScreen`, `TransporteurHomeScreen`, `AdminDashboardScreen`) covering rendering and logout are passing.
- **Integration Tests (New):**
    - Initial app state shows `LoginScreen`.
    - Successful Traveler signup.
    - Successful Transporteur signup (pending state).
    - Traveler login/logout/login cycle.
    - Transporteur login/logout/login cycle (pending state).
    - Failed login due to incorrect password.
    - Failed signup due to duplicate email.
    - Logout flow isolation.
    - Password reset request flow.
    - Navigation between auth screens (Login ↔ Signup ↔ Forgot Password).

## What's Left To Build / Next Steps
- **Backend:** Implement Supabase `handle_new_user` trigger to populate `profiles` on signup.
- **Feature Development:** Build core booking and reservation UI and integration.
- **Booking Integration Tests:** Write integration tests for trip search and booking flows.
- **Offline & Scanner Flow:** Implement offline ticket validation and related tests.
- **Implement actual content/features** for Traveler, Transporteur, and Admin home screens.
- Implement localization fully.
- Implement remaining features outlined in PRD/tasks (booking, payments, scanning, etc.).

## Known Issues
- **Supabase Trigger Required:** Signup flow will not fully work (profile/role won't be available after signup) until the `handle_new_user` trigger is implemented in Supabase.
- **`AuthService` Unit Test Limitation:** `getCurrentUserAppModel` unit testing is impractical due to mocking limitations; requires Integration Test coverage.
- **Analyzer Info Messages:** Several `const` suggestions remain (non-blocking).
- **Placeholders:** UI text uses placeholder strings instead of localization.
