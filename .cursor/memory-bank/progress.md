# Progress

## Current Status
- **Overall:** Build is **likely stable** after resolving `build_runner` conflicts and regenerating mocks. Verification is pending.
- **Functionality:** Core authentication, routing, and the Supabase `handle_new_user` trigger are implemented.
- **Next:** Run `flutter analyze` to check code health (Step 1 of revised plan). Following that, run integration tests (`flutter test integration_test/auth_flow_test.dart -v`).

## What Works (Potentially Verified / Ready for Verification)
- Flutter project setup & platform support.
- Task management system.
- Memory Bank populated and synchronized.
- Supabase DB Schema & RLS applied.
- Backend Supabase `handle_new_user` trigger implemented and deployed.
- Dart models defined.
- Auth UI Screens (`LoginScreen`, `SignupScreen`, `ForgotPasswordScreen`) implemented.
- `SplashScreen` implemented.
- `AuthService` and `AuthProvider` implemented.
- Role-based routing/navigation implemented using `go_router`.
- Placeholder role-specific home screens created.
- Logout functionality implemented.
- Session persistence handled by `supabase_flutter`.
- Tooling: Supabase CLI installed. Mock generation working with downgraded `build_runner`.
- Standardization/Refactoring applied (AuthService signature, Enums, Service calls, UI fixes).
- **Unit Tests:** Stable for `AuthProvider` (mostly) and `AuthService`.
- **Widget Tests:** Should be passing.
- **Integration Tests:** Implemented and **ready for re-execution** post-build fix.

## What's Left To Build / Next Steps (Revised Plan)
1.  **Run Analysis:** Execute `flutter analyze`.
2.  **Address Analysis Issues:** Fix any critical issues reported.
3.  **Run Integration Tests:** Execute `flutter test integration_test/auth_flow_test.dart -v`.
4.  **Address Test Failures:** Debug and fix any test failures.
5.  **Feature Development:** Resume work on Traveler Booking Workflow or other pending features once auth flow is stable.
6.  Implement remaining features (actual home screen content, offline sync, scanner, etc.).
7.  Implement localization.

## Known Issues
- **Analyzer Uncertainty:** Status of static analysis issues unknown after build fixes.
- **Potential Test Failures:** Integration tests may fail due to UI interaction issues previously masked by build problems. Verification needed.
- **`AuthService` Unit Test Limitation:** `getCurrentUserAppModel` unit testing impractical (mitigated by integration tests).
- **Placeholders:** UI text/features incomplete.
