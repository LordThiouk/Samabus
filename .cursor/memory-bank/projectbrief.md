# Project Brief

## Project Name
Plateforme de Réservation de Bus (MVP)

## Project Type
Mobile & Web Platform MVP (Flutter/Web)

## Description
Develop a unified mobile and web platform for booking intercity bus tickets in regions where the process is often fragmented and paper-based. The platform targets both travelers seeking a simple booking experience ("search → book → pay → ride") and independent bus operators (transporteurs) needing tools for fleet/trip management and ticket validation.

## Primary Goal
Launch an MVP featuring:
- Smooth multi-channel booking (web + mobile) for travelers.
- Secure, automated payment processing (Orange Money, Wave, card via PayDunya/CinetPay) with 5% commission handling.
- Offline ticket validation (QR code + ID number using Hive/SQLite for local caching) for operators.
- Basic admin panel for user/transporter management, monitoring, and analytics.
- Essential features: User registration/auth (3 roles), trip search, seat selection, passenger info capture (Name+CNI), e-ticket generation, booking history, transporter fleet/trip management, notifications (email, SMS, push), FR/EN localization, and GDPR-style data handling (30-day CNI retention).

## Success Metrics (MVP)
- Onboard 3-5 active transporteurs.
- Process initial paid bookings with successful e-ticket generation and validation.
- Gather early user feedback for future iterations.
